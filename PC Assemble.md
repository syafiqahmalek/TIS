# PC Assemble
date: 20 October 2024

**What I learn:**
I learn how hardware compartment works and their function. Usually I only learn it theoretically but during PC Assemble class, I could see and understand how it works and it truly amaze me because it's my first experience. During the PC assembly session, I learned how to assemble the key components of a computer, including the motherboard, CPU, RAM, power supply, and hard disk. I now understand how each part contributes to the overall functioning of the system.

**Reflection:**
During the PC assembly session, I learned a lot about how each hardware component fits into the overall structure of a computer. At first, I was a bit nervous about handling the parts, since it's my first experience. Turns out, it's really fun and exciting. The most challenging part I faced was figuring out how to correctly install the RAM, but my instructor told us to that the clips on the sides needed to snap into place until 'click' sound is heard. In conclusion, this hands-on experience helped me connect the theory from class with practical skills, and Iâ€™m eager to continue improving my ability and learn more.
