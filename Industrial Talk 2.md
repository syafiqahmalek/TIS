**Reflection:**
The industry talk taught me that success in computer science requires a balance of technical and soft skills. While mastering programming languages, version control, and frameworks is essential, I also learned that skills like management, communication, and problem-solving are just as important. The focus on security, debugging, and database management highlighted the need for a solid technical foundation. Additionally, the emphasis on leadership and teamwork showed me the value of collaboration and risk management in the workplace. This talk has motivated me to work on both my technical expertise and interpersonal skills to better prepare for the industry.
